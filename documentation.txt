We will create a virtual environnement on our computers. 
  python3 -m venv nameofthevenv
In it we will upload all the needed extarnal librairies by using the pip command.

All the librairies are required to run the differents files but our venv is not share(Because it's heavy and useless)
We use :
  py -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
to create a requirements text file with all the used librairies and there version

Use :
  pip install -r requirements.txt
to upload all the librairies and there version wich are in requirement.txt in your own venv
